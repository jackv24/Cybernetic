# Cybernetic
Cybernetic is a 3D tower defence game developed using Unity, in which the player must place and upgrade towers in order to stop the enemies from reaching their base.

The game will follow a basic tower defence formula, including building rounds and waves of attacks, with the ability to place towers on a grid between rounds, including upgrading and repairing. In addition to this, the camera will be a free-moving camera – meaning that the player will be able to pan, zoom, and orbit the camera.

Enemies will start at the enemy spawner when a round starts, and attempt to follow the level path to the player’s base, where they will cause damage. If the base is destroyed, the player has lost the current level.
The game will be separated into levels, with each level introducing new elements of gameplay.
